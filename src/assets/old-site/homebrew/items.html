      <h3 id="blast-disk">Blast Disk</h3>

      <p class="hb-source">Da Exploring Eberron</p>

      <p>

<em>Oggetto meraviglioso, varia</em>

</p>

      <p>A blast disk holds destructive arcane power. A typical blast disk is about nine inches in diameter and one inch thick, made from layers of different metal; dragonshards are embedded in the surface of the disk and arcane symbols are engraved in its surface. Anyone studying the surface of the disk can make an Intelligence (<span class="hb-skill">Arcana</span>) check corresponding to the save DC of the disk. On a success, they identify the spell effect contained within the disk. There are three elements to a blast disk: the trigger, payload, and charge. Each effect is selected at the time it is created.</p>

      <p></p>
<p><strong>Trigger.</strong></p>
<p>A spellcaster touching a blast disk can use an action to activate it. However, generally you don't want to be holding a blast disk when it goes off. A blast disk can be created with one of the following triggers, or with a more complex trigger of the creator's choosing (e.g. to detonate when a certain word is spoken, when a specific object comes within range, etc.):</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Time.</strong> When the disk is activated, the user can set a time delay of up to 10 minutes before it releases its effect.</li>
<li>
<strong>Proximity.</strong> 30 sectons after the disk is activated, it can trigger when someone comes within a certain distance of the disk or when someone first makes contact with the disk, then breaks that contact.</li>
<li>
<strong>Impact.</strong> The activated disk can be set to detonate on impact, then used by throwing or dropping it.</li>
</ul>

      <p></p>
<p><strong>Payload.</strong></p>
<p>When the blast disk is triggered, it produces one of the following magical effects, chosen when it was manufactured:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Explosive..</strong> This creates an explosion in a 20-foot radius centered on the disk. Each creature in the area must make a <span class="hb-dc">DC 13</span> Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (<span class="hb-damage">2d10</span>) damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. An explosive blast disk deals triple damage to objects or structures. The damage type is set when the disk is created.</li>
<li>
<strong>Spell Effect..</strong> The disk produces a spell effect when triggered. The effect must target either a single creature—whoever triggers the disk—or an area of effect centered on the disk. The level of the spell in the disk determines the saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the item's rarity, as shown on the Blast Disk Power table.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

</table>

      <p></p>
<p><strong>Charge.</strong></p>
<p>A typical blast disk holds a single charge, the dragonshards shattering when the effect is triggered. However, more advanced blast disks recharge at dawn; this increases the rarity of the disk by one category.</p>

      <p></p>
<p><strong>Disarming a Disk.</strong></p>
<p>When used on the battlefield, blast disks are typically buried or hidden. Finding the disk requires a successful Intelligence (<span class="hb-skill">Investigation</span>) check, with a DC equal to the ability check that was used when it was hidden, such as Wisdom (<span class="hb-skill">Nature</span>) or Dexterity (<span class="hb-skill">Sleight of Hand</span>). To disarm a blast disk, a character with proficiency in <span class="hb-skill">Arcana</span> must succeed on a Dexterity check using {<a href="https://github.com/item" class="user-mention">@item</a> thieves' tools|phb}, with a DC equal to the save DC of the disk. If the check is failed by 5 or more, the disk detonates as if it were triggered. Successfully disarming a blast disk expends one charge, meaning most blast disks will be rendered inert after disarming.</p>

      <p class="hb-source">Da Valda's Spire of Secrets</p>

      <p>

<em>Oggetto meraviglioso, comune</em>

</p>

      <p>This round bell is enchanted to be perfectly silent.</p>

      <p>It only rings when its magic is disrupted, such as within an <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/antimagic%20field">antimagic field</a></span>.</p>

      <h3 id="battle-rod">Battle Rod</h3>

      <p class="hb-source">Da Exploring Eberron</p>

      <p>

<em>Rod, comune</em>

</p>

      <p>The battle rod was developed as an alternative to the longer war staff, and has gained popularity with wandslingers across Khorvaire. The battle rod serves as a spellcasting focus and can be used by any spellcaster who can use a rod as a focus.</p>

      <p>When held in two hands, you can use the rod to cast cantrips at up to twice the standard range. However, when you cast a cantrip beyond the standard range, your attack rolls have disadvantage, and other creatures have advantage on any saving throws made against your cantrip. So a <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/fire%20bolt">fire bolt</a></span> cast using a battle rod has a range of 240 feet, but attack rolls against targets more than 120 feet away are made at disadvantage.</p>

      <p class="hb-source">Da The Griffon's Saddlebag</p>

      <p>

<em>Wand, comune</em>

</p>

      <p>This crystalline, prismatic wand can channel the illustrative intent of its wielder. While holding the wand, you can cause the end to leave behind an arcane pigment of your choice, allowing you to draw in midair or on any surface the end of the wand touches. The effect is illusory, visibly magic, radiates dim light out to 5 feet, and dissipates after one hour of completing a drawing.</p>

<em>Oggetto sconosciuto (gem), comune</em>

</p>

      <p>This ruby flickers like a torch, giving off 5 feet a bright light and an additional 5 feet of dim light when not socketed. When socketed into a weapon, as an action you can cause the weapon to burst into flames, dealing an extra <span class="hb-damage">1d4</span> fire damage for 1 minute. Once used in this way it can't be used again until dawn. When socketed into a ring or necklace, a creature wearing that piece of jewelry can use their action to cast the <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/produce%20flame">produce flame</a></span> cantrip.</p>

    </div>



<div class="card hidden">

      <h3 id="lesser-wand-of-cantrip">Lesser Wand of Cantrip</h3>

      <p class="hb-source">Da KibblesTasty's Crafting Guide</p>

      <p>

<em>Wand, comune</em>

</p>

      <p>This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the spell infused in it it. For 1 charge, you cast the base version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend (if applicable for the spell). The DC of the spell is crafter's Wand DC.</p>

      <p>The wand doesn't regain charges naturally, but can be recharged (see recharge rules for Lesser Wands).</p>

      <p></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Recharging Lesser Wands</strong></p>
<p>Recharging lesser wands is fairly simple; you can either expend 1 essence of the rarity required to craft that wand and perform a ritual that takes 2 hours, expending the essence and restoring all charges to the Lesser Wand (this only works with Lesser Wands), or you can expend 2 spell slots equal to the level of the spell the wand can cast (1st level for cantrip) during this ritual to recharge a single charge; you can repeat this ritual to recharge the wand multiple times, up to its maximum charges.</p>
</blockquote>

<em>Oggetto meraviglioso, comune</em>

</p>

      <p>This pair of magical glasses fits snugly against your face without needing to rest over your ears. The lenses are made using miniscule prisms that amplify color in dim conditions. If you have {<a href="https://github.com/sense" class="user-mention">@sense</a> darkvision} while wearing these glasses, you perceive color for the first 15 feet you see in darkness, instead of shades of gray. In addition, a color blind creature wearing these glasses can perceive color normally.</p>

</p>

      <p>This wand has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/prestidigitation">prestidigitation</a></span>.</p>

      <p>The wand regains <span class="hb-dice">1d4 + 2</span> expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a <span class="hb-dice">d20</span>. On a 1, the wand breaks, dumping the last 10 instances of filth it has cleaned up.</p>

<em>Oggetto meraviglioso, non comune</em>

</p>

      <p>Until they are worn, the boots of the trail appear to be in grave disrepair. When you lace them up, the illusion fades: they are immaculate hiking boots with gold clasps and silk laces. While wearing these boots, you leave behind no tracks or other traces of your passage, and can't be tracked except by magical means. You can march for twice as long before suffering levels of <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions">exhaustion</a></span>.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you can remove the boots and speak a command word as an action to cause the boots to walk alone, leaving a false trail in any direction for up to one mile. The boots then teleport back to your feet.</p>

      <p>An rune formed of detailed concentric circles that faintly glimmers with soft purple glow.</p>

<p><strong>Passive Effect.</strong></p>
<p>When marked on armor or an item, or a weapon, an attuned wielder takes no falling damage.</p>

      <p></p>
<p><strong>Active Effect.</strong></p>
<p>While attuned to an item with this rune, you can use that item to cast <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/levitate">levitate</a></span> as a bonus action without expending a spell slot. This uses the creator's Rune DC (set at the time of carving the rune). Once a rune's power is used, the rune's active can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>

</p>

      <p>These manacles behave the same as normal manacles with the following addition: a creature that attempts to cast a spell while wearing the manacles must make a DC 12 ability check using its spellcasting ability. On a failure, the spell fails and has no effect; the spell slot is expended, the action is wasted, and the manacled creature takes <span class="hb-damage">1d6</span> fire damage per level of the spell slot expended. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and the spell is cast successfully.</p>

When you walk 5 or more feet on your turn, you can expend 1 or more charges to set the ground alight behind you.

<em>Oggetto meraviglioso, raro (richiede sintonia)</em>

</p>

      <p>Questa sfera è in sintonia con un semipiano univoco per ogni utente, e permette di catturare creature al suo interno. Entrare in sintonia con una di queste sfere permette di entrare in sintonia con altre 2 sfere catturanti, senza che contino per il numero di oggetti magici in sintonia.</p>

      <p></p>
<p><strong>Cattura.</strong></p>
<p>Può essere lanciata come azione a una creatura che ne rispetta i requisiti. Se colpita, tira un dado cattura, che è un <span class="hb-dice">d8</span>. Se superi il GS della creatura, la creatura viene catturata nel semipiano, ed è affascinata (<span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions">charmed</a></span>) da te, come da un incantesimo amicizia su animali (animal friendship) di livello 3. Altrimenti, la sfera cade ai piedi della creatura, essa recupera 3 dadi vita, e perde lo stato di incosciente, se presente. Se il risultato è 1, il tiro fallisce, e la sfera si rompe.</p>

      <p></p>
<p><strong>Rilascio.</strong></p>
<p>Come azione, è possibile fare uscire la creatura dalla sfera. Finchè è affascinata, seguirà i tuoi comandi, finchè essi non arrechino danno a sè stessa. Se subisce danni da te o dai tuoi compagni, può tentare un tiro salvezza su Saggezza a CD 15 per liberarsi dall'effetto. Puoi fare rientrare la creatura nella sfera come azione bonus se è ancora affascinata. Se il suo GS è superiore al tuo livello, può tentare il tiro salvezza per liberarsi anche prima di rientrare nella sfera.</p>

      <p></p>
<p><strong>Liberare.</strong></p>
<p>Una creatura all'interno della sfera può essere permanentemente liberata come azione. Non sarà più affascinata da te.</p>

      <p></p>
<p><strong>Requisiti.</strong></p>
<p>Possono essere catturate solo creature di tipo bestia, mostruosità, pianta o melma, con Intelligenza pari o inferiore a 4. Devono essere incoscienti, paralizzate o sotto 20 punti ferita. Se non sono incoscienti, il tiro del dado cattura è fatto con svantaggio. La sfera non può catturare creature sapienti, a discrezione del DM (sei in grado di capire magicamente se una creatura sia catturabile).</p>

      <p></p>
<p><strong>Varianti.</strong></p>
<p>L'oggetto ha varianti più potenti, distinguibili dalla rarità:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Molto raro. Il dado cattura diventa <span class="hb-dice">1d12</span>, e la sfera può catturare anche creature di tipo costrutto, elementale, folletto, drago e immondo. Il limite di Intelligenza diventa 6, e il requisito dei PF per la cattura aumenta a 30. La CD del tiro per liberarsi diventa 18. L'effetto magico è considerato come di livello 5.</li>
<li>Leggendario. Il dado cattura diventa <span class="hb-dice">1d20</span>, e la sfera può catturare creature di ogni tipo tranne umanoide e gigante. Il limite di Intelligenza diventa 8, e il requisito dei PF per la cattura aumenta a 40. La  CD del tiro per liberarsi diventa 21. L'effetto magico è considerato come di livello 7.</li>

Any target within 5 feet of the point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes <span class="hb-damage">4d8</span> bludgeoning damage, and if it's Medium or smaller, it is also pushed 10 feet away from the point.

<em>Oggetto meraviglioso, molto raro</em>

      <p>This tome of cooking recipes is magically enchanted to turn sheets of fine paper into delectable meals. You can write a simple recipe on one of the book's pages over the course of 1 minute. As you do, the paper becomes aromatic, smelling like the cuisine you're writing. You can eat the sheet of paper as an action and find that it has the taste, texture, and smell of the food described on its page. The sheet of paper takes the place of one meal.</p>

      <p>If you add a more complex recipe to the book that takes at least 10 minutes to writeâ€”potentially using sensory language, descriptions of fine ingredients, or illustrations of the dishâ€”eating the delicious sheet of paper provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day. A creature that eats from the book using one of these complex recipes gains and has their hit point maximum increase by <span class="hb-dice">1d10</span> + their proficiency bonus until they finish a long rest. In addition, if the creature is diseased or <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions">poisoned</a></span>, it can reattempt the saving throw in order to resist it. A creature can only gain the benefits of a complex recipe in these ways once every 24 hours.</p>

      <p>In addition, you can use this book as a spellcasting focus when casting the create food and water spell should you know it. When you do, the food and drink you create can be aromatic and flavorful, recreating dishes from the book of your choice.</p>

      <p>The book can hold up to 50 pages. It comes with <span class="hb-dice">3d10 + 10</span> blank pages as well as <span class="hb-dice">1d10</span> filled pages containing complex recipes.</p>

      <p>When all the pages are removed from the book or you attempt to rebind it, roll a <span class="hb-dice">d20</span>. On a 1, the tome bursts into fire and leaves the air in a 20 foot radius smelling like wine and fine cooking. The smell remains for 30 days. In addition upon rolling a 1, the book's tattered remains transform into a bountiful meal, conjuring a heroes' feast as if cast. The book is then destroyed. On any roll other than a 1, the book can be rebound using fine paper costing no less than 5 gp per page.</p>

      <p>As a bonus action, or a reaction to being hit by an attacker you can see, you can spin the ring's jewel, causing it to expand into a hollow block of clear ice that completely surrounds you.

Spells and other magical effects can't extend through the iceberg or be cast through it.</p>

      <p>The iceberg is an object with AC 10 and 100 HP. If it was activated as a reaction, it takes as much of the triggering damage as possible.

      <h3 id="wand-of-puppetry">Wand of Puppetry</h3>

      <p class="hb-source">Da The Griffon's Saddlebag</p>

      <p>

<em>Wand, molto raro (richiede sintonia)</em>

</p>

      <p>This wand is made of wood and looks like the handle of a marionette. The wand has 7 charges. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to attach a number of magical strings equal to the charges spent to a humanoid that you can see within 60 feet of you. You can attach 1 string to each of the creature's limbs, including its head. For example, a humanoid with two legs, two arms, and only one head could have a maximum of 5 strings attached to it. The strings are <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions">invisible</a></span>, but can be seen by a creature with a successful DC 16 Intelligence (<span class="hb-skill">Arcana</span>) check. Dealing 10 slashing damage with a magical weapon attack to one of the strings (AC 10) causes it to detach and disappear. At the end of each of its turns, a strung creature can make a DC 16 Strength saving throw, breaking free of and destroying any number of the strings connected to it on a success. The strings break early if the creature is more than 100 feet away from you.</p>

      <p>While a creature has a string attached to one or more of its limbs, the following effects occur depending on the location of the strings:</p>

      <p></p>
<p><strong>Arm or Hand.</strong></p>
<p>A creature with a string attached to one of its arms or hands must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw each time it attempts to use it, such as making a weapon attack, climbing a wall, or using an item. On a failed save, the action, attack, check, or saving throw fails and is lost. If an action requires multiple arms and only one of the creature's arms has a string attached, it makes this saving throw with advantage. If the strung arm is holding a shield, the creature doesn't gain the benefits of holding it for the duration. In addition, you can use an action to force the creature to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw, dropping any number of items it's holding with the strung arms or hands on a failure.</p>

      <p></p>
<p><strong>Head.</strong></p>
<p>A creature with a string attached to its head has disadvantage on Intelligence checks, Wisdom (<span class="hb-skill">Perception</span>) checks, and Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on a spell when it takes damage. You can use an action to force the creature to speak on your turn, saying a word or phrase no longer than twenty-five words.</p>

      <p></p>
<p><strong>Leg.</strong></p>
<p>A creature with a string attached to one or more of its legs (or similar limbs) has its speed reduced by 15 feet for each strung limb. If a flying creature's speed is reduced to 0 in this way, it falls to the ground at a rate of 60 feet per round and takes no falling damage when it lands. A creature with a string attached to each of its legs has disadvantage on Dexterity (<span class="hb-skill">Acrobatics</span>) checks and Dexterity saving throws.</p>

      <p></p>
<p><strong>Spell.</strong></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can expend 5 charges to cast the <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/dominate%20person">dominate person</a></span> spell (save DC 16) from the wand.</p>
<p>The wand regains <span class="hb-dice">1d6 + 1</span> expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a <span class="hb-dice">d20</span>. On a 1, the wand becomes nonmagical.</p>

<em>Oggetto meraviglioso, artefatto (richiede sintonia)</em>

</p>

      <p>Questa speciale {<a href="https://github.com/item" class="user-mention">@item</a> sfera catturante} permette di catturare ogni tipo di creatura, eccetto creature sapienti a discrezione del DM. Non occorre tirare un dado cattura: ogni cattura ha un successo assicurato, e l'effetto è considerato pari ad un incantesimo di livello 9. Per tutto il resto è considerata analoga alla variante leggendaria dell'oggetto.</p>
