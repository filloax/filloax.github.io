<h3 id="prehistoric-figurine-of-wondrous-power-jasper-tyrannosaurus-rex">Prehistoric Figurine of Wondrous Power, Jasper Tyrannosaurus Rex</h3>







<p class="hb-source">Da BGG</p>

<p>

<em>Oggetto meraviglioso, leggendario</em>

</p>






<p>Larger and more roughly hewn than typical figurines of wondrous power, these statuettes depict dinosaurs and related creatures from the earliest days of the world.</p>




<p>As an action, you can throw a prehistoric figurine of wondrous power to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself while speaking a command word, whereupon the figurine magically transforms into a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.</p>




<p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. See the Monster Manual for the creature's statistics.</p>




<p>The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its statuette form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong><span class="hb-creature">tyrannosaurus rex</span>.</strong></p>
<p>This figurine, crafted from rare green jasper, becomes a <span class="hb-creature">tyrannosaurus rex</span> for up to 1 hour. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 14 days have passed.</p>
<p>Whenever you command the figurine while it's in tyrannosaurus rex form (including commanding it to revert to figurine form), you must roll a <span class="hb-dice">d20</span>. On a 1, you lose control of the figurine, and it becomes hostile to you and your companions until it is reduced to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to figurine form.</p>

<p>This greenish blade was forged under the command of a powerful aboleth as a reward for one of its strongest mortal thralls. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>




<p>While attuned to this sword, your Intelligence score is 19. It has no effect on you if your Intelligence is already 19 or higher without it. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra <span class="hb-damage">1d8</span> psychic damage. While holding the sword, you have resistance to psychic damage.</p>




<p>In addition, when you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this sword, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw or be <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions">stunned</a></span> until the start of your next turn, as it's bombarded by a deluge of unintelligible images and thoughts from a realm beyond comprehension.</p>

<p>This titanic hammer resembles a darkened globe of impenetrable black iron. When you hit with an attack made with this magic hammer, it deals <span class="hb-damage">2d12</span> bludgeoning damage, instead of <span class="hb-dice">2d6</span>. This weapon deals double damage to objects and structures.</p>




<p>In addition, you can use an action to cast the <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/earthquake">earthquake</a></span> spell from the hammer (save DC 17), slamming the weapon into the ground as part of the action to cast it. You and up to 10 other creatures of your choice that you can see automatically succeed on the saving throw against being knocked <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions">prone</a></span> by the spell. This version of the spell extends from you in a 100-foot radius and does not require concentration, but ends at the end of your next turn. Once this property of the hammer has been used, it can't be used again until a number of days have passed equal to the number of fissures created by the spell (minimum of 1 day).</p>

</p>






<p>This black or dark blue robe is embroidered with small white or silver stars. You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws while you wear it.</p>




<p>Six stars, located on the robe's upper front portion, are particularly large. While wearing this robe, you can use an action to pull off one of the stars and use it to cast <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/magic%20missile">magic missile</a></span> as a 5th-level spell. Daily at dusk, <span class="hb-dice">1d6</span> removed stars reappear on the robe.</p>




<p>While you wear the robe, you can use an action to enter the Astral Plane along with everything you are wearing and carrying. You remain there until you use an action to return to the plane you were on. You reappear in the last space you occupied, or if that space is occupied, the nearest unoccupied space.</p>

<p class="hb-source">Da The Griffon's Saddlebag</p>

<p>

<em>Oggetto meraviglioso, molto raro (richiede sintonia)</em>

</p>






<p>An astral bracelet is a powerful magical bangle that allows its wearer to see, commune, or otherwise manifest things using powers beyond the Material Plane. The metal and glyphs of each bracelet are related to the kind of power that it holds. You can pull the bracelet off and hold it in the palm of your hand as an action. When you do, the bracelet unfurls to reveal the four inner rings collapsed within it, transforming the bracelet into an astronomical sphere. While the bracelet is transformed into the astronomical sphere, its inner rings slowly spin on their own.</p>




<p>The bracelet has 10 charges and regains <span class="hb-dice">2d4 + 2</span> expended charges each day dawn. While holding the astronomical sphere, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of its spells. The sphere's spinning rings magically fold up again into the wearable bracelet if you expend the last charge from the sphere. You can fold the rings back into place early as an action. You can wear the bracelet again once its rings are folded up  again (no action required).</p>




<p>Each bracelet can cast a different array of spells and may require different creatures to attune to them. Spells cast using the bracelet while it's an astronomical sphere use your spellcasting modifier and spell save DC. Components that cost less than 100 gp are ignored when casting a spell in this way.</p>

<p class="hb-source">Da DMG</p>

<p>

<em>Oggetto, raro (richiede sintonia)</em>

</p>






<p>This staff has 10 charges and regains <span class="hb-dice">1d6 + 4</span> expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a <span class="hb-dice">d20</span>. On a 1, a <span class="hb-creature">swarm of insects</span> consumes and destroys the staff, then disperses.</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong>Spells.</strong></p>
<p>While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/giant%20insect">giant insect</a></span> (4 charges) or <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/insect%20plague">insect plague</a></span> (5 charges).</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong>Insect Cloud.</strong></p>
<p>While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause a swarm of harmless flying insects to spread out in a 30-foot radius from you. The insects remain for 10 minutes, making the area heavily obscured for creatures other than you. The swarm moves with you, remaining centered on you. A wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses the swarm and ends the effect.</p>

<h3 id="figurine-of-wondrous-power-coprolite-monkeys">Figurine of Wondrous Power, Coprolite Monkeys</h3>







<p class="hb-source">Da TCEE1</p>

<p>

<em>Oggetto meraviglioso, raro</em>

</p>






<p>A figurine of wondrous power is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.</p>




<p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.</p>




<p>The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong>Coprolite Monkeys.</strong></p>
<p>These statuettes of chimpanzee-like apes in brownish stone are always created in sets of three. Each can become an <span class="hb-creature">ape</span> for up to 10 minutes. Once it becomes an ape in this way, that statue cannot be used again until 7 days have passed.</p>
<p>As an action, each ape has the ability to grapple a creature, climbing onto the creature's back. While grappling a creature in this way, the ape cannot take other actions and the creature is affected by a special condition, depending on the statue as described below. The effect lasts until the creature escapes the grapple or the ape turns back into a statue.</p>
<p>One statue depicts an ape covering its eyes. Creatures <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions">grappled</a></span> by this ape are <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions">blinded</a></span>.</p>
<p>One statue depicts an ape covering its ears. Creatures <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions">grappled</a></span> by this ape are <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions">deafened</a></span>.</p>
<p>One statue depicts an ape covering its mouth. Creatures <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions">grappled</a></span> by this ape cannot speak, make sounds verbally, or perform the verbal components of spells.</p>

<p class="hb-source">Da DMG</p>

<p>

<em>Oggetto meraviglioso, raro</em>

</p>






<p>This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.</p>




<p>Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.</p>




<p>The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.</p>




<p>Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a {<a href="https://github.com/item" class="user-mention">@item</a> bag of holding}, {<a href="https://github.com/item" class="user-mention">@item</a> portable hole}, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10-feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.</p>

1d8 perforanti  <span>- accurato</span>
</div>
</div>





<p>This elegant brass rapier was originally wielded by a beloved king, whose empathy and care for his subjects lives on within the blade. When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra <span class="hb-damage">1d8</span> fire damage. In addition, you can use this rapier as a spellcasting focus.</p>




<p>The rapier has 7 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, a number of gems inside the guard equal to the weapon's remaining charges glow red. When you expend a charge from the rapier, it releases a plume of dark smoke from one of the gems.</p>




<p>If an attacker makes a spell attack against you or a target within 5 feet of you while you're holding the rapier, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack misses and was a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain 1 expended charge.</p>




<p>While holding the rapier, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to give one of three decrees that affect the flow of magic and battle:</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong>Clemency.</strong></p>
<p>When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a single creature, you can use your reaction to expend 2 charges to cause a different creature within 10 feet of the original target to regain <span class="hb-dice">1d8</span> hit points per spell level. When you do, both creatures have advantage on the next ability check or saving throw it makes before the end of its next turn.</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong>Condemn.</strong></p>
<p>When you cast a spell that deals damage to a single creature, you can use your reaction to expend 2 charges to cause that target as well as a different creature within 10 feet of it to make a Charisma saving throw using your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes <span class="hb-damage">3d8</span> fire damage and has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much fire damage and makes its next attack roll as normal.</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong>Overrule.</strong></p>
<p>After you roll dice to restore hit points to a single creature or roll damage for a spell attack or attack using this weapon, you can expend up to 2 charges (no action required) to change the result of those dice. For each charge you spend, you can use the highest number possible for two of those dice instead of the numbers you rolled.</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong>Flaw.</strong></p>
<p>The Violet King's promise makes its wielder empathic and reluctant to resort to violence. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: "I am slow to resort to violence, even if it's at the cost of my own safety." In addition, if you are attuned to the weapon for 24 consecutive hours, your soft-heartedness causes you to lose your ferocity and battle-readiness. You have disadvantage on Charisma (<span class="hb-skill">Intimidation</span>) checks and suffer a-5 penalty to initiative. These effects can be be removed with a greater restoration spell, but not while you are attuned to the weapon.</p>

<p>This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>




<p>The staff has 10 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using it, you can expend up to 3 of its charges. For each charge you expend, the target takes an extra <span class="hb-damage">1d6</span> force damage. The staff regains <span class="hb-dice">1d6 + 4</span> expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a <span class="hb-dice">d20</span>. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.</p>

<p>This thick, stony quarterstaff requires a Strength of 17 or higher to wield. Despite glowing with crackling embers, it feels comfortably warm in your grasp. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>




<p>The quarterstaff has 6 charges and regains <span class="hb-dice">1d6</span> expended charges each day at dawn. Once per turn, you can expend a charge when you make a melee weapon attack using the quarterstaff. When you do, you make the attack as normal before slamming the weapon into the ground at your feet. Immediately following the attack, the ground in a 10-foot cone in the direction that the attack was made in shudders and briefly tears apart. Flames leap from the cracks in the ground, forcing any creature within the cone to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes <span class="hb-damage">1d8</span> bludgeoning damage and <span class="hb-damage">1d8</span> fire damage. If a creature that was hit by the initial melee weapon attack fails this saving throw, it is also knocked <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions">prone</a></span> if it is no more than one size larger than you.</p>




<p>The ground magically mends itself following the attack, although faint cracks can be seen upon close inspection for the next 24 hours.</p>

<p>This wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains <span class="hb-dice">1d6 + 1</span> expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a <span class="hb-dice">d20</span>. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong>Command.</strong></p>
<p>While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and command another creature to flee or grovel, as with the <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/command">command</a></span> spell (save DC 15).</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong>Cone of Fear.</strong></p>
<p>While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 2 charges, causing the wand's tip to emit a 60-foot cone of amber light. Each creature in the cone must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions">frightened</a></span> of you for 1 minute. While it is <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions">frightened</a></span> in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the {<a href="https://github.com/action" class="user-mention">@action</a> Dash} action or try to escape from an effect that prevent it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the {<a href="https://github.com/action" class="user-mention">@action</a> Dodge} action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

<p>This well worn leather eyepatch is enchanted with the illusion of a devil's eye on the front. While wearing this eyepatch over a missing eye, you can magically see as if you weren't missing one at all. The embroidered eye adorning the front of the patch swivels and moves as you look around while wearing it. You don't gain this benefit if you wear this patch over a working eye.</p>




<p>In addition, while wearing the eyepatch over a missing eye, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to gain {<a href="https://github.com/sense" class="user-mention">@sense</a> darkvision} out to a range of 60 feet for 1 hour. If you already have {<a href="https://github.com/sense" class="user-mention">@sense</a> darkvision}, this effect increases its range by 60 feet. While this property is in effect, you can see through magical darkness as if it were normal darkness. Once this property of the eyepatch has been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn.</p>

<p>This mechanical lance has bladed edges on either side of the weapon's base and has the heavy property. You can use a bonus action on your turn to extend or retract the weapon by twisting the metallic band around the handle. While extended, the weapon behaves as a normal lance. While retracted, the end of the lance nests inside the wider, bladed base of the weapon and can be used as a makeshift greatsword instead. The damage die for the retracted lance is still a <span class="hb-dice">d12</span>, but deals slashing damage instead of piercing.</p>




<p>You can choose to release the spring-loaded mechanism and extend the retracted lance using a bonus action following an attack. If the target is a creature no more than one size larger than you, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be forced backward up to 5 feet. If you extend the lance immediately after successfully hitting the creature, the creature makes the saving throw with disadvantage.</p>

<em>Oggetto meraviglioso, non comune</em>

</p>






<p>This minuscule, mechanical beetle is 1 inch long and quietly whirs with a mix of magical and mechanical forces. Placing the beetle on a piece of parchment you hold or carry causes it to spring to life and begin tracking your travels. As you move, so does the beetle. It leaves behind a small line of ink that it generates. The ink immediately dries and doesn't dissolve in water. In addition. the beetle's small frame allows it to move even while enclosed in a book or similar enclosure without losing its sense of movement or direction.</p>




<p>The beetle has a dial on its underside. A creature can use the dial to select the scale in which the beetle moves. For each option, the beetle moves 1 inch in the same direction as you for every amount you move as shown on the dial, creating a map of your journey: 20 feet, 200 feet, 2 miles, or 20 miles. The beetle is immune to magical effects that would otherwise alter its sense of direction.</p>




<p>The beetle always knows which direction is North. When placed on a piece of parchment for the first time, it crouches down to stamp a small compass rose on the sheet before beginning to move. If the beetle runs out of space on the parchment to travel, it stops moving in that direction and emits a clicking sound that can be heard by creatures within 5 feet of it.</p>




<p>Attaching one band of the found and lost to the beetle while you wear the other allows the beetle to move and trace your movements in this way from afar so long as you are both on the same place of existence.</p>

<h3 id="rat-king-crown">Rat King Crown</h3>







<p class="hb-source">Da The Griffon's Saddlebag</p>

<p>

<em>Oggetto meraviglioso, non comune (richiede sintonia)</em>

</p>






<p>This dark silver circlet is embossed with the heads and tails of many rats. While wearing it, ordinary rats, giant rats, and swarms of rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.</p>




<p>In addition, you can comprehend and verbally communicate with rats, as if by the speak with animals spell.</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong>Mark of the Rat King.</strong></p>
<p>While you're attuned to one or more other items with "rat king" in its name, the crown gains the following additional property.</p>
<p>Whenever you roll initiative, roll a <span class="hb-dice">d6</span>. On a 5 or 6, a swarm of rats gathers at your location, provided that enough rats are within a half mile of you (as determined by the GM). The swarm is friendly to you and your companions. It remains with you until the combat ends or you die. If the swarm is reduced to half its hit point maximum or less, it scatters and leaves early.</p>
<p>The friendly swarm shares your initiative but takes its turn immediately after yours. On its turn, it attacks the nearest hostile creature within 30 feet of you. If there isn't a creature to attack, it shares your space and takes the {<a href="https://github.com/action" class="user-mention">@action</a> Dodge} action.</p>
<p>The swarm becomes hostile if you remove the crown or if you or your companions harm it.</p>

<p class="hb-source">Da The Griffon's Saddlebag</p>

<p>

<em>Oggetto meraviglioso, molto raro</em>

</p>






<p>These iron pendants come in pairs and are connected by a powerful bond of self-sacrifice. In order to create this bond, you and a friendly creature with whom you are close perform a brief, 1 minute ritual to connect your destinies and forge a blood pact. When you create this blood pact, you must each agree on a number of hit points to permanently sacrifice, reducing your total maximum hit points (minimum 1). Once a pact has been forged, trickles of the bound creatures' blood are absorbed into the normally clear gem adorning the face of this pendant. While the gem is filled in this way, it seems to gently swirl and pulse in time with your heartbeat.</p>




<p>While each bound creature is wearing their pendant and are on the same plane of existence, they're protected by this pact so long as one creature is still conscious. When a bound creature dies, they're immediately revived with <span class="hb-dice">2d10</span> hit points plus twice the number of hit points previously sacrificed by the creature. When a creature is revived in this way, the other bound creature immediately falls to 0 hit points and is knocked <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions">unconscious</a></span>. This property ignores any effect that would normally prevent a creature from falling to 0 hit points. When this happens, both creatures' maximum hit points are returned to normal. Once the pact is ended in this way, the gems and pendants crack and are no longer magical.</p>

<p class="hb-source">Da The Griffon's Saddlebag</p>

<p>

<em>Arma ravvicinata, molto raro (richiede sintonia)</em>

</p>






<p>This fungal staff has 25 charges and regains <span class="hb-dice">1d10 + 15</span> expended charges each day at dusk. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 or more charges as an action to cause clusters of noxious mushrooms to magically appear in a number of unoccupied spaces equal to the number of charges you expend. The spaces must be on solid ground and within 60 feet of you. Each space becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within an space or area with these mushrooms, it takes <span class="hb-damage">2d4</span> poison damage for every 5 feet it travels. The mushrooms live for 1 minute or until you dismiss them early (no action required).</p>




<p>In addition, while holding the staff, you can expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/cloudkill">cloudkill</a></span> (5 charges), <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/fog%20cloud">fog cloud</a></span> (1 charge), <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/insect%20plague">insect plague</a></span> (5 charges), or <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/stinking%20cloud">stinking cloud</a></span> (3 charges). These spells are cast using a bonus action instead of their normal casting time and must target a point adjacent to a space occupied by the mushrooms. In addition, these spells' duration becomes 1 round instead of their normal duration, ending at the end of your next turn, and do not require concentration.</p>




<p>If you expend the last charge from the staff, roll a <span class="hb-dice">d20</span>. On a 1, the staff begins to violently overgrow, forcing you to drop it in an unoccupied space adjacent to you. If the staff is dropped on solid ground, a violet fungus (Monster Manual p. 138) grows in its place.</p>

<p class="hb-source">Da The Griffon's Saddlebag</p>

<p>

<em>Oggetto meraviglioso, molto raro (richiede sintonia)</em>

</p>






<p>This singular lens lets you faintly see and command the flow of time around a target. The eyepiece has 5 charges and regains <span class="hb-dice">1d4 + 1</span> expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the eyepiece, you can expend 1 charge as a reaction at the end of another creature's turn to speak either of the eyepiece's two command words to warp the flow of time around that creature. You must be able to see the target, and it must be within 60 feet of you.</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong>Past.</strong></p>
<p>If the target is willing, it is teleported back to the space it was at the beginning of its turn. If another creature or object is occupying the space, the target is teleported to nearest unoccupied space instead. An unwilling target must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be teleported in this way against its will.</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong>Future.</strong></p>
<p>If the target is willing, it can immediately choose to move again, up to half its speed, without provoking opportunity attacks. After a target moves in this way, its speed is halved until the end of its next turn.</p>

<p class="hb-source">Da The Griffon's Saddlebag</p>

<p>

<em>Oggetto meraviglioso, molto raro (richiede sintonia)</em>

</p>






<p>This leather bracer has a blue gemstone embedded on its wrist, which glimmers with an ethereal light. While wearing it, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls on ranged attacks made with longbows and shortbows.</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong>Summon Bow.</strong></p>
<p>You can use a bonus action to summon a spectral longbow or shortbow from the bracer's gemstone. The bow is weightless, allowing you to ignore the longbow's normal heavy property while holding it. The bow remains until you're holding another weapon, until you drop it, or until you dismiss it (no action required). While the weapon persists, it sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. It creates its own arrows, which magically appear in a knocked position whenever you draw the bow. Hit or miss, an arrow disappears after the attack or if you release the bowstring without firing the arrow.</p>
<p>Regardless of what bow you summon, it deals force damage instead of piercing damage.</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong>Charges.</strong></p>
<p>The bracer has 4 charges for the following properties. It regains all expended charges daily at dawn. The available properties are determined by the type of summoned bow.</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong>Grim Shot (Longbow or Shortbow).</strong></p>
<p>When you hit a target with an arrow that was created by the summoned bow, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra <span class="hb-damage">2d8</span> force damage to the target. This damage is in addition to the attack's normal damage.</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong>Piercing Blast (Longbow).</strong></p>
<p>When you take the {<a href="https://github.com/action" class="user-mention">@action</a> Attack} action using the summoned bow, you can replace one or more of your attacks with a special attack using the bow. You expend 2 charges per attack you replace in this way. When you do, you draw forth a cool beam of light from the weapon, instead of a spectral arrow. You fire this beam of light in a line from you that's 5 feet wide and 100 feet long. Each creature within the line must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take <span class="hb-damage">4d8</span> force damage.</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong>Stepshot (Shortbow).</strong></p>
<p>You can expend 1 charge as a bonus action to make one ranged attack against a creature using the summoned bow. On a hit, you teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see that's within 15 feet of you. You can't teleport to a space that's closer to the target of the attack in this way.</p>

<em>Oggetto meraviglioso, molto raro (richiede sintonia)</em>

</p>






<p>Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo features designs that emphasize one color (white).</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong>Tattoo Attunement.</strong></p>
<p>To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.</p>
<p>If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong>Damage Resistance.</strong></p>
<p>While the tattoo is on your skin, you have resistance to force damage.</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong>Damage Absorption.</strong></p>
<p>When you take force damage, you can use your reaction to gain immunity against that instance of the damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half the damage you would have taken. Once this reaction is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>

<p>The folds of this robe are virtually undetectable, as any light that touches it is mysteriously absorbed. Whenever you take radiant damage while wearing this cloak, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by <span class="hb-dice">1d10 + 10</span>. If you have the Sunlight Sensitivity trait, you are unaffected by that trait while wearing the robe.</p>




<p>In addition, you can use an action to cast either the pass without trace or unseen servant spell from the robe while wearing it. The unseen servant created by the robe appears as a shadowy figure in dim and bright light, but is <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions">invisible</a></span> in darkness. The servant remains for the duration of the spell, until it's reduced to 0 hit points, or until the cloak is used to cast the spell again. If the servant is destroyed, the robe can't be used to cast the spell again until the next dusk. Once the robe is used to cast <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/pass%20without%20trace">pass without trace</a></span>, it can't do so again until the next dusk.

<p>A bundled explosive alchemical preparation. It can be detonated by dealing 1 fire or lightning damage to it. As an action, a packet of this explosive can be accurately thrown 20 feet, but will not detonate on impact (usually). When it detonates, all creatures within 20 feet (for rare) of the target point must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to the crafter's Alchemy DC. On failure, they take <span class="hb-damage">4d8</span> fire + <span class="hb-damage">4d8</span> thunder damage, or half as much on a success.

<p class="hb-source">Da The Griffon's Saddlebag</p>

<p>

<em>Rod, raro</em>

</p>






<p>This industrial hollow rod is 3 feet long and weighs 15 pounds. The rod has a tapered spike on one end and an open, tower-like chimney on the other. Three hinged legs unfold from the sides of the rod, allowing it to stand upright with its spiked end pointed downward. Standing or collapsing the rod in this way requires an action.</p>




<p>The unfolded legs magically fasten the rod to the ground while its standing, but a creature can use its action to try to push it over with a successful DC 17 Strength check. Once the rod is no longer standing, it magically deactivates and collapses itself again.</p>




<p>As a bonus action, you can press a button on the standing rod to cause its mechanisms to churn and whir, repeatedly sending its spike into the ground below it. Pressing the button again deactivates the rod. The spike sends out loud, {<a href="https://github.com/item" class="user-mention">@item</a> drum|PHB}-like shockwaves every 6 seconds. The waves are audible out to 300 feet, or 1200 feet if a creature has {<a href="https://github.com/sense" class="user-mention">@sense</a> tremorsense}. If a creature has {<a href="https://github.com/sense" class="user-mention">@sense</a> tremorsense}, its range is halved while it's within 300 feet of the active rod. A creature can't perceive anything within 30 feet of the active rod using its {<a href="https://github.com/sense" class="user-mention">@sense</a> tremorsense}, but is aware that the disrupting shockwaves originate from that location.</p>

<em>Wand, non comune</em>

<p>This wand has a flared tip that leads down into the center of it. The wand has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to use one of the following properties:</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong>Absorb Sound.</strong></p>
<p>You point the wand at a non-living object that you can see within 30 feet of you, which can be no larger than 3 feet in any dimension. Until the end of your next turn, that object makes no noise (such as a squeaky door hinge or tumbling boulder), and any noise that it would have made for the duration is stored in the wand. A sound stored in this way can be released by the wand by using an action, without expending an additional charge from it. When you release a sound, you must also point the wand at a point that you can see within 30 feet of you. The stored sound then emanates once from that point for up to 6 seconds, after which the sound is lost from the wand. Unused stored sounds are lost daily at dawn.</p>




<p></p>
<p><strong>Thunderwave.</strong></p>

<em>Oggetto meraviglioso, non comune</em>

<p>Arkanite crystals are brittle red gems that are volatile when subjected to certain reagents. This cluster of arkanite is fused to a delicate glass vial of one such reagent. You can use an action to throw the cluster at a point you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do, the cluster and reagent vial shatter, resulting in an explosive reaction. Each creature within 20 feet of the point must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking <span class="hb-damage">4d6</span> piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>




<p>Immediately following the reaction, a single red crystal grows from the point of impact. The crystal grows in a cylinder that is 20 feet tall with a 5-foot radius, centered on the point where the vial shattered. It has 20 hit points, AC 13, and resistance to all damage except thunder damage or damage from siege weapons. The crystal is transparent, but heavily obscures everything seen through it. It remains for 1 hour or until it drops to 0 hit points. At the end of the duration, the crystal crumbles to dust and vanishes into smoke as it finishes its reactive process. A creature in the area of the crystal when it appears is either pushed to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of it or is lifted on top of the crystal (its choice).</p>

<em>Oggetto meraviglioso, non comune</em>

</p>






<p>These button-sized metal trinkets typically come in sets of two and resemble the fearsome visage of a one-eyed monster. As an action, you can place one firmly on a solid surfaceâ€”such as a wall, table, or bootâ€”where it remains until destroyed. While you're within 5 feet of one, you can use a bonus action to speak the command word to cause its eye to open. The opening is about the size of a keyhole, and by peering through it, you can open and see through another eye's opening of your choice. You choose which eye to look through the first time you peer into the hole and can change it again using a bonus action.</p>




<p>The eyes you can choose to see through in this way must be a part of the set, be placed on a solid surface, and be on the same plane of existence as the one you're looking through. You can only see through one eye at a time, which operates both ways, and nothing can pass through the hole. If another eye attempts to look through one you're already using, the connection between the first two ends and is replaced by the new one. An eye closes when it's no longer being looked through.</p>




<p>Each eye has AC 10 and 5 hit points. If it drops to 0 hit points, the eye is destroyed. If a target or area is immune to divination magic or can't be perceived through scrying sensors, it doesn't appear through the hole. If you find another eye of the beheld, you can connect it to an existing set by holding it against another eye from the set for 1 minute.</p>

<p>These robes are unique to the wearer and are spun from special, magic-sensitive threads. While wearing these robes, you gain an additional way to calculate your AC. Your AC equals 10 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Whenever you cast a spell of first level or higher, you can also change the apparent style, color, and apparent material of the robe. Regardless of its appearance, it is always a robe and its weight remains the same. Glowing, arcane glyphs appear on the robe's fabric when you cast a spell before fading away a moment later.</p>

<p class="hb-source">Da DMG</p>

<p>

<em>Instrument, non comune</em>

</p>






<p>You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become <span class="hb-spell"><a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions">frightened</a></span> of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren't hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain <span class="hb-dice">1d3</span> expended charges daily at dawn.</p>

<h3 id="shifter-s-shine-potion-common">Shifter's Shine (Potion) (common)</h3>







<p class="hb-source">Da The Griffon's Saddlebag</p>

<p>

<em>Pozione, comune</em>

</p>






<p>The typical shifter's shine, a common potion, is a specialty alcoholic beverage that causes your face to appear more glamorous. For 1 hour after drinking this potion, your skin's complexion clears, appears healthier, and grows more taut. Your face, while largely unchanged, is distinctly more attractive and exudes a weak aura of enchantment magic. When you make a Charisma check while under the effects of this potion, you can choose to forgo rolling the <span class="hb-dice">d20</span> to get a 10 on the die. Once you use this property, you can't use it again for the remainder of the potion's duration. The potion is a rich honey color and swirls lazily around, regardless of how it's handled. It can be found in any sort of vessel, though it is usually found in glass jars. The eye of a shapeshifter drifts along the potion's bottom, making it a daunting beverage for the average taverngoer to order. It has an extremely strong alcoholic taste with a hint of caramel. Due to its magical nature, the alcohol within this potion affects a creature twice as much as the alcohol within a nonmagical beverage.</p>




<p>The following shifter's shine is an uncommon variant with additional properties. It also tastes better.</p>




<p>When you drink this potion, you gain the effects of the alter self spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action.</p>

</p>






<p>If you plant an ordinary shrub in this 10-pound clay pot and let it grow for 30 days, the shrub magically transforms into an <span class="hb-creature">awakened shrub</span> at the end of that time. When the shrub awakens, its roots break the pot, destroying it.</p>




<p>The awakened shrub is friendly toward you. Absent commands from you, it does nothing.</p>

<em>Wand, comune</em>

<p>This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and target a humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or be forced to scowl for 1 minute.</p>




<p>The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a <span class="hb-dice">d20</span>. On a 1, the wand transforms into a {<a href="https://github.com/item" class="user-mention">@item</a> wand of smiles|xge}.</p>
